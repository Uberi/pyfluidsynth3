# pyfluidsynth3

Python 3 binding for [FluidSynth](http://www.fluidsynth.org/). 

It is loosely based on the Python 2 binding projects [pyFluidSynth](http://code.google.com/p/pyfluidsynth/) and [pyfluidsynth](https://github.com/MostAwesomeDude/pyfluidsynth). Code snippets which are directly copied from one of the projects are marked. The licenses should allow this but please correct me if i'm wrong. I will try to implement at least all of the features of this projects. Maybe higher level features like support for the [abc notation](http://abcnotation.com/) will follow.
